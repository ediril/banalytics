# Key Principles
- Always create the smallest possible diff to implement a feature.
- Implement exactly what is requested. Do not do additional work. If there is ambiguity, 
first ask for guidance and confirmation.
- Don't keep backwards compatibility when making changes.
- Always test your changes, make sure they work as expected and did not break any previous 
- **Minimal Changes**: When implementing features, make the smallest possible change that achieves the desired outcome
- **Code Deletion**: Actively look for opportunities to delete or streamline existing code during feature implementation
- **Refactoring**: Prefer extracting common patterns into reusable components to reduce duplication
- **Less is Better**: Favor simplicity over complexity - remove unused exports, parameters, and code paths
- **DRY Principle**: Eliminate code duplication through component extraction and parameterization


# JavaScript Guidelines
